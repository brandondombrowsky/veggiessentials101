The PDF file in this repo holds the expanded digital edition of my 2015 self-published hardback cookbook, and 2018 digial re-release, *Veggiessentials 101*. The 2018 digital release was part of a fundraising campaign to combat food insecurity in the pacific northwest (see crowdfunding video [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/fullthisfall)).

Completing this projext included management overseeing production from start to finish: receipe testing, layout, design, management of graphic designers and photographers, photo/film editors, general book sales, and marketing.
