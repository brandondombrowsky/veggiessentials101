# veggiessentials101
The PDF file in this repo holds the expanded digital edition of my 2015 self-published cookbook, Veggiessentials 101.
The digital edition was published in 2018 as a fundraising tool to combat hunger insecurity in the Pacific Northwest
with Northwest Harvest (Seattle metro) and Meals On Wheels People (Portland metro) as beneficiaries.
