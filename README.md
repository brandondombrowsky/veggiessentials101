The PDF file in this repo holds the expanded digital edition of my 2015 self-published cookbook, Veggiessentials 101.
The digital edition was published in 2018 as a fundraising tool to combat hunger insecurity in the Pacific Northwest
with Northwest Harvest (Seattle metro) and Meals On Wheels People (Portland metro) as beneficiaries. One hundred
percent of the proceeds was split evenly between the two organizations.
